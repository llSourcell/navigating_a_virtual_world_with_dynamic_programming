    "- In RL we have an agent interacting with an environment\n",
    "- At each time step, the agent performs an action which leads to two things: changing the environment state and the agent (possibly) recieving a reward (or penalty) from the enviroment. \n",
    "- The goal of the agent is to discover an optimal policy (i.e. what actions to do in each state) such that it maximizes the total value of rewards recieved from the environment in response to its actions. \n",
    "- MDPis used to describe the agent/ environemnt interaction settings in a formal way.\n",

    "- Deterministic environments are easier to solve, because the agent knows how to plan its actions with no-uncertaintiy given the environment MDP. \n",

    "- where T is the horizon (episode length) which can be infinity if there is maximum length for the episode\n",
    "- The reason for using discount factor is to prevent the total reward from going to infinity (because 0 ≤ 𝛾 ≤ 1)\n",
    "- it also models the agent behaviour when the agent prefers immediate rewards than rewards that are potentially recieved far away in the future\n",

    "### The solution to an MDP is called a \"policy\" and it simply specifies the best action to take for each of the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### But Although the policy is what we are after, we will actually compute a value function because we can easily derive the policy if we have the value function. A value function is similar to a policy, except that instead of specifying an action for each state, it specifies a numerical value for each state.\n",

    "- Two fundamental methods for solving MDPs are policy-iteration and value-iteration algorithms\n",
