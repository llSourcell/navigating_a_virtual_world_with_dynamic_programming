    "- In RL we have an agent interacting with an environment\n",
    "- At each time step, the agent performs an action which leads to two things: changing the environment state and the agent (possibly) recieving a reward (or penalty) from the enviroment. \n",
    "- The goal of the agent is to discover an optimal policy (i.e. what actions to do in each state) such that it maximizes the total value of rewards recieved from the environment in response to its actions. \n",
    "- MDP is used to describe the agent/ environment interaction settings in a formal way.\n",

    "- State transition model that describes how the environment state changes when the user performs an action a depending on the action and the current state st.\n",
    "- Reward model that describes the real-valued reward value that the agent recieves from the environment after performing an action. In MDP the reward value depends on the current state and the action performed.\n",

    "- Deterministic environments are easier to solve, because the agent knows how to plan its actions with no-uncertaintiy given the environment MDP. \n",

    "- Where T is the horizon (episode length) which can be infinity if there is maximum length for the episode\n",
    "- The reason for using discount factor is to prevent the total reward from going to infinity (because 0 ‚â§ ùõæ ‚â§ 1)\n",
    "- It also models the agent behaviour when the agent prefers immediate rewards than rewards that are potentially recieved far away in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "### The solution to an MDP is called a \"policy\" and it simply specifies the best action to take for each of the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### But Although the policy is what we are after, we will actually compute a value function because we can easily derive the policy if we have the value function. A value function is similar to a policy, except that instead of specifying an action for each state, it specifies a numerical value for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two fundamental methods for solving MDPs are policy-iteration and value-iteration algorithms\n",
    "- Both assume that the agent knows the MDP model of the world (model-based)\n",

    "# In Policy Iteration algorithms, you start with a random policy, then find the value function of that policy (policy evaluation step), then find an new (improved) policy based on the previous value function, and so on. In this process, each policy is guaranteed to be a strict improvement over the previous one (unless it is already optimal). \n",
